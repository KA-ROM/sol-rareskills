# shared goals between both ERCs
they both want to build ontop of erc20 by primarily saving gas and allowing code execution after token transfer/approval **without sending a 2nd trasaction/paying gas twice**

777 and 1363 are two different attempts to enable code execution after token transfers/recieval (in the same call).

## 777:

777 accomplished the goal above by holding a registry that collects contracts/interfactes to-be called on hooks such as transfer, approve, send, burn, mint, etc. 

* based on erc20, but with more advanced features
* advanced features include:
    * allowing operators to send tokens on behalf of another address—contract or account
        The holder can “authorize” and “revoke” operators which can send tokens on their behalf. These operators are intended to be verified contracts such as an exchange, a cheque processor or an automatic charging system.
    * allowing send/receive hooks to offer token holders more control over their tokens in the same call (to minimize gas?)
        The tokensReceived hook allows to send tokens to a contract and notify it in a single transaction, unlike ERC-20 which requires a double call (approve/transferFrom) to achieve this.

777 exists bcus there is no way to execute code after a ERC-20 transfer or approval (i.e. making a payment), so to make an action it is required to send another transaction and pay GAS twice.

## 1363:

1363's solution to allow 2 actions in one call is the creation of methods/interfactes transferAndCall and approveAndCall, which only interfaces with non EOAs that match the expected interfaces. there is no registry, and protects against lost token due to only working with non-EOAs that assert (through interfaces) tokens it works with.

"ERC-1363's focus on specific interfaces for receivers and spenders can make it more suited for applications requiring actions triggered by token operations without the broader and more complex hook system of ERC-777."
